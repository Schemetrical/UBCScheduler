# Fixing UBCScheduler
UBC Course Scheduler

Things you can do:

-	add courses and auto generate schedules
-	restrict courses based on time (eg. no 8am)
-	lock sections that you want

Things it can't do (yet)

-	Filter by status (Restricted, Full)
-	generate term 1 & 2 at the same time
-	auto enroll in selected timetable
-	inform you why timetables cannot be made (whether it's scheduling conflict, no sections available, etc)

I think it's super cool. I hope you do too!

Please help me make this better by contributing! I'm not a web dev by any means so I apologise for the spaghetti.
